# MutualisticInteraction
The prey-predator system is probably the most common example of appliccation of Lotka-Volterra and Verhulst models. In such systems, the growth of one species has a negative effect on the growth of the other, in the same way as an increase number of predators undermine the population of their preys. In contrast, in this example the focus lies on investigating beneficial rather than negative interactions between different species, i.e. mutualism. Mutualistic interaction are very common in nature and can unfold in different ways depending on the situation. The benefit that one species can bring to a different one is usually classified as a form of resource or service. Some examples are: • Resource-resource mutualism: rhizobia bacteria fix nitrogen that become available to be used by leguminous plants, that in turn provide sugars to the rhizobia. • Service-resource: many animals disperse seeds or pollen in return of food. • Service-service: sea anemones provide protection to anemone fish, and anemone fish protect sea anemones against butterflyfish, that eat anemones. In this report, a model of mutualism between two species developed by Graves et al. (2006) is explained and several relevant outcomes arising from the model are analyzed. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed, that is to say, a study of how sensitive the solutions of the system are to variations of the parameters.
